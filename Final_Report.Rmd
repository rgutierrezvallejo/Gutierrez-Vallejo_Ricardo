# Results

## Subsections are ok in the results section too

Add a number of code chunks in the Results section. These should read in, subset and plot the data as needed (no need to save any figures to pdf, since they will be put into the rendered document when you click 'knit'), and, for any hypotheses that you want to test, an appropriate statistical test. 

```{r load-packages}
